**debris** is a simple bliki_ for personal purposes.

As of now, the bliki is pretty simple - you create/edit pages that can have
created date and tag meta data. You can list pages by tag.

**Nice to have features:**

 - Edit in emacs (using ATOM API?) as it has got a good ReST major mode.
 - Paging
 - Tag clouds and other tag navigation
 - Respond by email (like Google Groups UI)
