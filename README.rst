**debris** is a simple bliki_ for personal purposes.

I might drop this project and start a new one where you store pages in
git repository itself albeit with a datastore based cache to perform
GQL queries.

	
**Nice to have features:**

 - Code Cleanups
 - Test cases
 - Paging
 - Tag clouds and other tag navigation
 - Respond by email (like Google Groups UI)
