debris is a simple bliki for personal purposes.

Milestone 0.1
=============

   Purpose: deploy for real world usage (www.nearfar.org) - for publishing
            articles and, well, blog posts if I feel like.
			
			
   Features
   --------
   
		- Categories:               pages should be navigatable by categories
		                            (just like wikipedia?)
									
		- Backup:                   periodically download the datastore data
		                            in case google goes out of business or does
									something 'evil'
									
	Nice to have
	-------------
	
		- Code Cleanups
		- Test cases
		- Paging
		- Respond by email:         comments are not supported, but there
		                            should be a way to 'respond' to every page
								    (for UI: see reply option in google groups)
